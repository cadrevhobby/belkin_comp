Code for the Kaggle Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition

This repo contains the code I wrote for the Kaggle Belkin Energy comp.  The code is in the root directory and there is a sub-level directory with the data (not included in the repo).  If you need to get the data, there is a bash script in the code folder, and instructions to run the script are in the comments.
